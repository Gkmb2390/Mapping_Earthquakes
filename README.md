# Mapping_Earthquakes.

## Objective

  Show the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth. Additionally, we need to create a layer that shows only earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map.  Finally, we need to add a third map style to the existing project.
